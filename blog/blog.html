        <i>10 November 2024</i>
        <p>Sooo... My name is Rasmus and I'm from northern Sweden. I think I made this website in August of 2024. <br>This website is mostly for me to practice my coding skills and web my developement. And today I bought a domain.<br> So, in this blog I will write som stuff I do with the website, and the date above it. (So I can see when the changes were made)<br> Today I also tried localhosting so I could connect with different devices, but I gave up after some trouble with MySQL,<br>I wanted that to test databases. I have also changed all the hyperlinks to buttons with the same CSS. I think it looks much better!<br> I have also made it so you can download the entire website, but I will rarely update it since it takes a lot of timeto do so.<br> I think this will do for the day, I hopefully write some tomorrow!</p>

        <p>Today I made a donation system. A weird one, you donate through Steam items. If you go to the donation page you'll see why, <br>and you will get all information to donate so we can keep the website up and running with a custom domain, <br>which is much better than a regular GitHub repository URL. I have also added links to some other stuff that's outside of this website. <br></p>
        
        <i>14 November 2024</i>
        <p> I made an admin page where you need the right password to enter the admin page. I didn't make much more than that. <br>I can't really tell you about the admin page because it's and <i>admin</i> page.</p>

        <i>16 November 2024</i>
        <p>I made a snake game for the website. I have two Get Coding book and i used Get Coding 2 to write the snake game. It took a few hours to make it. <br> Very simple game, yet it is so addictive! I've also updated the admin page with something pretty useless yet useful. <br> I've also made a pong game using the same book. You play against an AI, though it is not very smart.<br> I have also added a favicon, I will probably change but I just wanted to test favicons!</p>

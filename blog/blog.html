        <i>10 November 2024</i>
        <p>Sooo... My name Is Rasmus and I'm from northern Sweden. I think I made this website In August of 2024. <br>This website Is mostly for me to practice my coding skills and wee my developement. And today i bought a domain.<br> So, In this blog I will write som stuff I do with the website, and the date above It. (So I can see when the changes were made)<br> Today I also tried localhosting so I could connect with different devices, but I gave up after some trouble with MySQL,<br>I wanted that to test databases. I have also changed all the links to buttons with the same CSS. I think it looks much better!<br> I have also made it so you can download the entire website, but I will rarely update it since it takes a lot of timeto do so.<br> I think this will do for the day, I hopefully write some tomorrow!</p>

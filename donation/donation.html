        <b>Donation works a bit different here</b>
        <p>Donation works different here because this is smaller and not a real company. Just me wanting a website.<br> So how do you donate? You can send stuff like CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) skins to me, and then i sell them.<br> Anything i can sell will do.<br></p>

        <b>Examples of items to donate me</b>
        <p>You can trade items through Steam trading to donate. These items can come from any game in Steam but i'll<br> be most thankful if it's from bigger games like Counter-Strike 2 or Team Fortress 2. But as I said <i>anything works.</i></p>
            <br>
        <b>How to trade items with me (donate)</b>
        <p>To do so, follow this link to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=1183464002&token=KQv-7pT9">my Steam trading URL</a>. Now send the item you would like to donate, then i will sell it on a <br>third party market to get real money and not just Steam currency.</p>
